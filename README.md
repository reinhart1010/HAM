# HAM ðŸ¥©

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> **BREAKING CHANGE:** HAM is currently being upgraded to Halfmoon 2.0, which introduce visual breaking changes. See <https://github.com/reinhart1010/HAM/issues/6>.

{% youtube 0FKaIiRhUME %}

HAM is a Jekyll-based boilerplate template for generating better, static wiki-style websites. HAM can be instantly used to build static wiki pages. But the best of all, the default theme of HAM can be easily customized to create more personalized wiki pages, unlike those from MediaWiki, for example.

This project is built to replace the current, MediaWiki installation at <hackapedia.reinhart1010.id> after I found out difficult to create custom styles for it, while other, Git-based alternatives such as GitHub Wiki sucks (no, really) and may not support self-hosting on shared hosting providers.

## What does HAM stand for?
HAM is short for:

+ Hackapedia's Abstraction Machine
+ HAM Ain't MediaWiki
+ [Halfmoon] and Markdown
+ && i++ (can we get more pull requests to add more stuff into this list?)

## Why does HAM look boring?
HAM ships the default [Halfmoon] theme by default, which might be considered boring by some. But that's the beauty of it, because **HAM supports Halfmoon's CSS variables to play with!**

We believe that everyone should be able to theme HAM websites according to their brand and preferences, [including us over @reinhart1010 and @1010bots](https://github.com/reinhart1010/dotfiles/blob/main/halfmoon.css).

## Features
### What HAM is
- [x] A static-site wiki generator
- [x] A better alternative than GitHub pages
- [x] Highly customizable through [Halfmoon] and [Jekyll]
- [x] Uses GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM)
- [x] Optimized for GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages

### What HAM isn't
- [ ] Optimized for large wiki content (this is where advanced alternatives such as [MediaWiki] excels at)
- [ ] Built-in support for hosting content written in MediaWiki markup syntax (however there are converters to Markdown)
- [ ] Supported in legacy web browsers (see [Compatibility](#browser-compatibility))

### What HAM would be
- [ ] Supporting Forem (DEV.to) liquid tags (YouTube embeds, Twitter posts, etc.)

## Usage
### For [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
If you would like to add this theme into your GitHub Pages website, please just add the following on your `_config.yml`

```
remote_theme: reinhart1010/HAM
```

Note that this instruction will only work if you still opt in to GitHub Pages' "classic" experience - the same old workflow without having to write your own GitHub Actions. Users who opt in to use GitHub Actions instead should install this as a regular Gem-based theme.

The best part of this is that you can get the latest version of HAM without manually requiring it on your Gemfile, as long as you have updated your page frequently (GitHub will fetch the current available version of the HAM "theme").

### As a Gem-based theme
HAM is also available as a [Gem-based theme](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-ham) on the official Ruby gems repository. If you are unsure on installing gem-based themes like this one, check out the [official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme) for that.

If you have just created a new site with `jekyll new <PATH>` chances are that you're using the default, Minima theme instead of HAM. If that's the case, replace the line which begins with

```gemspec
gem "minima"
```

on your `Gemfile` with

```gemspec
gem "jekyll-ham", "~> 0.3.3"
```

Also don't forget to change the `theme` configuration on your `_config.yml` to `jekyll-ham` instead of `minima`.

### Site does not load properly after first `jekyll build`?
In previous versions of HAM (0.1.5 and earlier), all of your Markdown and HTML files must include the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
layout: page
---
```

However, as of 0.1.6 `jekyll-optional-front-matter` has been included and configured by default to remove this requirement, which allows easier content migration for future wikis.

## Configuration
HAM also introduces additional configuration which you can set on your `_config.yml`:

### Site Identity
```yaml
ham:
  site_icon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/main/svg/emoji_u1f969.svg # Your site icon, to be displayed on navbar
  site_favicon: null # Your site favicon, in case you have a spare favicon.ico for it
  site_meta:
    - name: google-site-verification
      content: AAAAAA
    - name: msvalidate.01
      content: BBBBBB
  contributing: # Additional metadata for "Contribute to This Page" section on sidebar
    discuss: # For "Discuss" (or "Talk page" on MediaWiki)
      type: url | custom | commentbox.io | disqus | facebook | giscus | telegram | utterances
      url: https://github.com/reinhart1010/HAM/discussions/
    view_source_base_url: https://github.com/reinhart1010/HAM/blob/main/ # The base URL to publicly view the original (Markdown) source code
    issue_url: https://github.com/reinhart1010/HAM/issues/ # The URL to report an issue related to site or content
```

Note: You can also override the whole favicon settings (either to entirely remove, or adding mobile or browser-specific icon formats) by overriding `_includes/favicon.html`.

### Navigation
HAM currently provides two navigation areas: the **navigation bar** and the **index** (as on the sidebar).

#### Navigation Bar
You can freely add items in the navigation bar by modifying `_includes/navbar.html`, including placing additional nested menus, dialogs/modals, and other HTML tags.

#### Sidebar
Just like the "On This Page" section, you can add custom sections into the sidebar. Note that the configuration is stored **outside** the `ham` section of `_config.yml` (see below example).

```yaml
ham:
  # Other HAM configuration here
data:
  index:
    - name: "Customise Me"
      id: "customize-me"
      children:
        - name: "Sample Menu 1"
          url: "#"
        - name: "Sample Menu 2"
          url: "#"
        - name: "Sample Menu 3"
          url: "#"
```

### Comments
HAM provides built-in support for Facebook, Giscus, Telegram, and Utteranc.es widgets plugins. However, you can also add your own widgets or links by following these instructions.

#### URL (Default)
If you have a dedicated forum or discussion webpage, such as GitHub Discussions, you can link them directly to all HAM pages by setting Jekyll's `_config.yml` as below.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: url
      url: https://github.com/reinhart1010/HAM/discussions/
```

#### Custom Comments Widget (HTML code)
You can use an custom-made comments widget (e.g. JavaScript-based or `<iframe>` element) into HAM by placing the code under `_includes/custom-comments.html`. You can also use Jekyll-specific variables and attributes including `site.title`, `site.ham.contributing.issue_url` and `page.tags` to render custom widget code.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: custom
```

#### CommentBox.io
To set up CommentBox.io for HAM, [follow their installation instructions](https://commentbox.io), and modify the `_config.yml` according to the values obtained from the generated HTML snippet.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: commentbox.io
      project_id: CommentBox.io Project ID
```

#### Disqus
To set up Disqus for HAM, [follow their installation instructions](https://commentbox.io), and modify the `_config.yml` according to the values obtained from the generated HTML snippet.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: disqus
      forum_shortname: example-forum # Disqus forum shortname, such as `example-forum` from `https://example-forum.disqus.com`.
```

#### Facebook
HAM includes an external JavaScript from Facebook in order to render the Facebook Comments Widget. You are also required to register your website as an app on Facebook, [switch from Development Mode to Live/Public Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes), and insert your App ID and preferred language into the configuration below.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: facebook
      facebook_app_id: 123456789
      lang: en_US
```

#### Giscus
[Giscus](https://giscus.app) is yet another comment widget plugin powered by GitHub Discussions. To set up Giscus for HAM, [follow their installation instructions](https://giscus.app), and modify the `_config.yml` according to the values obtained from the generated HTML snippet.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: utterances
      repo: data-repo
      repo_id: data-repo-id
      category: data-category
      category_id: data-category-id
      mapping: data-mapping
      reactions_enabled: data-reactions-enabled
      emit_metadata: data-emit-metadata
      theme: data-theme # "preferred_color_scheme" is preferred to allow HAM's dark mode integration to work smoothly
      lang: data-lang
```

#### Telegram (@DiscussBot)
HAM supports for Telegram's [@DiscussBot](https://t.me/DiscussBot) web comments widget. **This widget may not sync with comments on Telegram channels set up via [discussion groups](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots).**

To set up the widget, follow the instructions provided on <https://comments.app> under your Telegram account, and modify the `_config.yml` according to the values obtained from the generated HTML snippet.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: telegram
      telegram_discussion: data-telegram-discussion
      comments_limit: data-comments-limit # Optional, default: 5
      height: data-height # Optional
      color: data-color # Optional
      dark_color: data-dark-color # Optional 
      dark: data-dark # Optional, default: 0
```

#### Utterances
> **DEPRECATED:** The value `utteranc.es` has been deprecated, removed, and replaced with `utterances` (without the dot).

[Utterances](https://utteranc.es) is yet another comment widget plugin powered by GitHub Issues. To set up Utterances for HAM, [follow their installation instructions](https://utteranc.es), and modify the `_config.yml` according to the values obtained from the generated HTML snippet.

```yaml
ham:
  contributing:
    discuss:
      type: utterances
      repo: data-repo
      issue_term: issue_term # optional
      theme: theme # "preferred-color-scheme" is preferred to allow HAM's dark mode integration to work smoothly
```

## Browser Compatibility
HAM heavily uses [Halfmoon] CSS framework on the generated page due to its theming flexibility based on CSS variables. However, that comes with a cost: **CSS variables are not supported in old browsers**. If you're thinking of Internet Explorer 11, well, don't think too far, because this exact feature may not be supported on some smart TV models, too! There are plans to either include a JavaScript-based polyfill or fallback CSS for this, but I might want to do that later.
